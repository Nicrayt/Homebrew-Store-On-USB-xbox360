# **Homebrew Store On USB**

### **By *nicray*** | Cheato | Derf




##### If you have two USB drives plugged into the console, only USB0 will be recognized. If you want to use your second USB drive (USB1), you must download the second version of the script.

##### If you encounter any issues during homebrew installation — such as a sudden Aurora crash after installing an app — please try again.

##### In case of serious problems like crashes or unintended file deletion, make sure USB0 or USB1 is properly recognized by the console.

##### 

##### This mod is still in its early stage: 'Alpha 0.1'.
