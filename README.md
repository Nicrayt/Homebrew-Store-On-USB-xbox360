###### **By *nicray*** | Cheato | Derf

### I modified an Aurora script called Homebrew Store. I changed it so it installs all applications onto a USB drive.
### I made this for people like me who donâ€™t have a hard drive, so they can still benefit from this script. The name of this script is 'Homebrew Store On USB


##### This script is still in its early stage: Alpha.
