# **Homebrew Store on USB**  

###### **By *Nicray*** | Cheato | Derf

### üìñ About  
I modified an Aurora script called **Homebrew Store**. This version installs all applications directly onto a **USB drive** instead of requiring a hard drive.  

I created it for people like me who don‚Äôt own a hard drive, so they can still enjoy using this script. That‚Äôs why I named it **Homebrew Store on USB**.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Development Status  
This script is still in its **early development stage (Alpha 0.11)**.
