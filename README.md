#### üìå Introduction  
If you don‚Äôt have a hard drive to install your homebrew apps, you can use this script with **Aurora** or other dashboards.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important notes:**  
- If two USB drives are plugged into the console, only **USB0** will be recognized.  
- If you encounter issues during installation (e.g., Aurora crashing after installing an app), simply try again.  
- In case of serious issues such as crashes or unintended file deletion, make sure **USB0** is properly recognized by the console.  
- Files from the Dashboard and Other categories are not copied automatically to the USB drive.
- This mod is still in its **early development stage (Alpha 0.11)**.
